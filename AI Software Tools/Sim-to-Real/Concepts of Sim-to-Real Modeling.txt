Concepts of Sim-to-Real Modeling:

Reality Gap – The difference between simulated and real-world environments that must be minimized for effective transfer.

Domain Randomization – Training models on diverse simulated variations to improve generalization.

Domain Adaptation – Using techniques like adversarial learning to align simulated and real-world distributions.

Invariant Feature Learning – Extracting high-level features that remain consistent across domains.

Causal Inference – Learning fundamental cause-effect relationships rather than correlations.

Meta-Learning – Training models to adapt quickly to real-world data.

Self-Supervised Learning – Using unlabelled data to improve real-world generalization.

Probabilistic Modeling – Estimating uncertainties in simulation-to-reality transfer.

Structural Risk Minimization – Ensuring robustness by learning fundamental task principles.

Bayesian Learning – Updating models with real-world observations for continuous improvement.
