Example: Energy Calculation Using Integration

Scenario:

A device's power usage varies over time and is given by the function P(t) = 5t + 20 (W), where t is in hours. Calculate the total energy consumed from t = 0 to t = 4 hours.

Formula:

E = ∫ P(t) dt
E = ∫ (5t + 20) dt from 0 to 4

Calculation:

E = [(5/2)t² + 20t] from 0 to 4
E = [(5/2)(4)² + 20(4)] - [(5/2)(0)² + 20(0)]
E = [40 + 80] - [0]
E = 120 Wh
