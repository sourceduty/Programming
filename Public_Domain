This table highlights notable examples of programming languages and software that are in the public domain due to expired copyrights or deliberate release by their creators. It includes early languages like ALGOL, FORTRAN, and LISP, whose foundational concepts and initial implementations are now free to use without legal restrictions. Legacy systems such as CP/M and MS-DOS 1.0 and 2.0 have also been partially or fully released into the public domain, offering historical value and educational utility. Additionally, early tools like TECO and Tiny BASIC represent a class of software that contributed significantly to early computing and remain accessible for experimentation and preservation. Understanding which components are in the public domain enables developers, historians, and educators to explore and reuse foundational technologies without licensing concerns.
